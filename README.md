# CatchAll
Species richness estimation in R (beta version)

CatchAll is a program that fits a large number of mixed-Poisson models to species abundance data and does model selection to choose the optimal estimate of species richness.

CatchAll (http://www.northeastern.edu/catchall/) only runs on Windows machines, and running it on a Unix system requires an emulator (the authors recommend mono). However, this is ridiculous, and so Amy Willis and Teresa Zhan set out to rewrite it into R. 

This is a **work in progress**, and is not ready for public consumption yet. Stay tuned!
