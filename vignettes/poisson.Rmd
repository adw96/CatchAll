`CatchAll` is a package for species richness estimation and modelling. It is based off the original CatchAll software program by Bunge et. al, but now coded into R and updated to reflect new use cases.

At this point, only the Poisson model is available to use. Here is an example of its use

```{r}
### Run the first two lines at home! ####
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("adw96/CatchAll")
library(CatchAll)
library(magrittr)
set.seed(1)
counts <- rpois(5000, 2)
counts <- counts[counts>0] 
x <- data.frame(table(counts))
x
PoissonModel(x)
PoissonModel(x, cutoff = 3)
```
